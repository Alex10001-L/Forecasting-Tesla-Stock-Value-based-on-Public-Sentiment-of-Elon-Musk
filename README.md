# Forecasting-Tesla-Stock-Value-based-on-Public-Sentiment-of-Elon-Musk
**Note- This project was accomplish with 3 other individuals. I was responsible for scraping Reddit comments, forecasting Tesla stock prices, and performing correlation analysis, which is why only these specific code sections are included.**

                                                      Executive Summary

Our project was inspired by our group's interest in exploring how public sentiment might influence stock prices. We focused on Tesla, a popular topic on platforms like X, YouTube, and Reddit, to analyze how public sentiment around Elon Musk and Tesla evolved over the past 18 months (October 2023 - April 2025). During this period, key events, such as the launch of the Tesla Cybertruck and Musk's appointment to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), shaped public opinion.

                                                      Research Questions:
1. "What is the projected Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and closing price of Tesla stock at the end of May 2025? **Note-The time we made this forecast was on April 2025**
2. How strong is the correlation between Teslaâ€™s stock value (VWAP and closing price) and public sentiment toward Elon Musk?
                                                      
                                                      Data:

1. Tesla stock data will be of two-year period (October 2023 to April 2025) that we scraped directly from the internet.
2. Comments from Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter/X are scraped from the internet and filtered to exclude any posts or comments mentioning Elon Musk. This process is used to gather information on public sentiment.


                                                        Model:

The predictive model for forecasting will be done using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, as it can capture long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in sequential data. The model was trained on historical stock data augmented with daily sentiment scores to evaluate whether incorporating social media sentiment improves forecasting performance. The evaluation metric to judge its predicitve accuracy will be Root Mean Sqaured Error (RMSE).
